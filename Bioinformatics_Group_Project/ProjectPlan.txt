1) Blast uniquetranscripts.fasta (nucleotide collection)
	Default highly similar sequence
	Save and download descriptions for table of hits to repo

2) Using unix, make a table that include the top hit for each transcript (6)
	Choose with highest percent identity and highest max score

3) Search NCBI protein database
	filter by taxon
	Choose 10-20 protein sequences
	Create 1 fasta file per transcript (6)

4) Write a script that translates RNAseq data to amino acid data
	output fasta file
	list of amino acids for each transcript

5) Build a HMM of the 6 transcript proteins
	Muscle alignment --> hmmbuild --> hmmsearch
	use bash script to loop over files

6) Graphically compare expression levels across groups
	Qualitatively compare results to Kuhns & Pluznick 2017
