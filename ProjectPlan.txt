Group members: Devin Shirley, Madison Karlin, Katherine Koczwara, Melissa Stephens

1) Blast uniquetranscripts.fasta (nucleotide collection)
	Default highly similar sequence
	Save and download descriptions for table of hits to repo
		-To be completed the first day by Katherine (Mon Nov 27)

2) Using unix, make a table that include the top hit for each transcript (6)
	Choose with highest percent identity and highest max score
		-To be completed the first day by Katherine (Mon Nov 27)
			-Both Psuedocode and Functional code

3) Search NCBI protein database
	filter by taxon (do both rodent, primate, and nonmammal DNA at this step for further exploration problem) 
	Choose 10-20 protein sequences
	Create 1 fasta file per transcript (6)
		-To be completed by wednesday nov 29 by Devin

4) Write a script that translates RNAseq data to amino acid data
	output fasta file
	list of amino acids for each transcript
		-to be completed by friday december 1 by Madison and Katerine
			-Katherine Psuedocode
			-Madison Functional Code 

5) Build a HMM of the 6 transcript proteins, search translated RNAseq files
	Muscle alignment --> hmmbuild --> hmmmodel
	hmmsearch RNAseq + hmmmodel 
	use bash script to loop over files
		-to be completed by monday december 4 by Devin
			-Both Psuedo and Functional Code

6) Graphically compare expression levels across groups
	Qualitatively compare results to Kuhns & Pluznick 2017
		-To be completed by wednesday december 6 by Melissa
			-Both Psuedo and Functional Code
		-Additional graph (not required) to be added by devin
			-Both Psuedo and functional code

Further Exploration Questions
	Question1. To be completed by Devin by Wednesday December 6
	Question2. To be completed by Melissa by Wednesday December 6

Additional Tasks:
Keep repository cleaned and organized: Devin
Continually update project summary: All
	-Keep it organized and make sure the information flows correctly: Melissa 
Check each script for comments: All 
Peer Review of other groups: All 

Meeting times: We will meet during each class time, the day before the group review, and the day before it is submitted to make sure everything works.
