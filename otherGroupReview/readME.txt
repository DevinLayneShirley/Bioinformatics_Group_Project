The word doc documents what comments we provided to the other group, the 
repo shows what they had done at the time we reviewed it (this might 
not be viewable, but based on their commits, you can probably elucidate 
what was available for review at 10:30AM december 6). Please keep in 
mind that at the time we reviewed their project they had not completed a 
large portion of it.
